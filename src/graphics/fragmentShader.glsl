    // which is what this did first — is useless for the purpose: that axis IS
    // the symmetry axis of the screen image, so rotating about it slides
    // points along the very circles the problem is made of. Latitude stays
    // constant around each one and the rings survive as spirals.
    //
    // About a fixed axis, how far a ray is dragged depends on where it passed
    // relative to that axis and not just on how close it came, so latitude
    // varies with azimuth and screen-radius circles stop mapping to sky
    // latitude circles. That is also the more honest version: a rotating
    // throat has a spin axis of its own, and light's inclination to it is
    // exactly what decides the drag.
    // The drag rides on a bounded measure of the winding, not on bend_eff.
    // bend_eff now grows without limit toward the centre, and a twist that
    // grew with it would pass a full turn somewhere in the capture disc and
    // wrap — a new circle to replace the one being removed here.
    // Held perpendicular to the view. A rotation about any axis leaves that
    // axis's two poles fixed, and a fixed point in a field of swirling is a
    // centre — so wherever the axis pierces the far sky, a second centre
    // appears next to the throat's own. Taking only the part of the tilt
    // that is across the line of sight throws both poles out to the rim,
    // where the throat's edge covers them, and leaves one centre in frame.

    // along the view is the screen image's own symmetry axis and does no

    // ── Supersampling the far side ──
    // One ray per pixel is one direction, and inside the throat that is not
    // enough: the mapping from screen to sky is steep, so a pixel covers a
    // long stretch of the far sky and a single tap picks one arbitrary point
    // out of it. Standing still that is noise; moving, the point jumps from
    // one feature to the next between frames and the whole interior crawls.
    //
    // Several taps spread across the direction the pixel actually covers, and
    // averaged, is the fix. Confined to here — it is the only place in the
    // frame where the mapping is steep enough to need it, and the throat is a
    // small part of the screen, so the cost is bounded.
    //
    // The spread grows with bend_eff because that is what makes the mapping
    // steep in the first place: deep in, where a pixel's worth of screen
    // covers most of a sky, the taps have to reach further apart to represent
    // it. Golden-angle spiral rather than a cross, so no tap pattern lines up
    // with the radial structure the throat is already full of.
    //
    // This also replaces the star blur while it runs. That widened the stars
    // on the plate to stop them aliasing; jittering the direction does the
