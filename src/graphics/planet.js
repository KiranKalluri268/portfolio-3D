// The system we arrive in needs a body in it, not just a black hole in an empty
// sky. The planet is a mesh rendered to its own target and sampled back by the
// raymarcher, the same trick the star field already uses — see
// createParticleSystem() — with two differences that matter.
//
// Stars are emitters and composite additively. A planet has a night side, and
// adding it would leave that side transparent with the sky showing through, so
// this target is composited alpha-over: the material writes an opaque alpha and
// the target is cleared to a transparent one.
//
// Both are sampled along the bent ray. The planet was on the straight one for a
// long time, because bending it warped the sphere and threw off a second lensed
// image that read as a detached sliver rather than as physics — both worst in
// portrait, where the black hole fills much more of the frame. That was at three
// times this size and five times this orbit radius. Small and near, the warp is
// invisible and the second image is the point rather than the cost: it is what
// lets the planet sit against the black hole instead of having to stay clear of
// it. See the planet block in fragmentShader.glsl.

const SEGMENTS = 64;

// How far from the black hole the planet sits. With the anchor angles below,
// this is the whole lever on how close to the black hole the planet looks
// through the first half of the fall, and it took two goes to see why.
//
// The separation the camera sees is atan(R sin f / (d + R cos f)), where R is
// this radius, f is the total angular offset of the anchor, and d is the camera
// distance. Two things fall out of it. Far out, d dominates the denominator, so
// the separation is small and R scales it almost linearly — that is the half of
// the fall this number controls. Close in, d drops away and the separation tends
// to f whatever R is, so the last frame is governed by the anchor angles alone
// and not by this at all.
//
// Which is why dropping 65 to 30 barely moved anything: it pulled the arrival in
// a little but left the crowded final frame where it was, so the anchor angles
// could not be opened up to compensate. Small radius with wide angles is the
// combination that works — near the axis while the black hole is far, well clear
// of it once the black hole fills the frame.
//
// The floor is the occlusion. The planet is composited in the shader's
// background block, which rays terminating at the horizon never reach, so the
// black hole covers whatever is behind it and nothing else does — free, and
// correct only while the planet really is the further of the two. Anchored
// beyond the black hole, camera-to-planet runs about 38 down to 16 against a
// camera-to-black-hole 30 down to 5. It holds, but the margin never gets above
// about 10 units, so this should not go much below 12.
//
// It used to be 65, outside the star shell. Inside it now, which changes
// nothing: the particle layers add over the planet rather than depth-testing
// against it, and always did.
const ORBIT_RADIUS = 12.0;

// Must match COMPOSE_SHIFT in fragmentShader.glsl, which slides the projection
// sideways so the black hole composes three quarters of the way across instead
// of dead centre. The planet is sampled by screen position, so its camera has to
// carry the same shift or the two disagree about where a direction lands.
const COMPOSE_SHIFT = 0.5;

// Where the planet is put, the first frame of the fall.
//
// Azimuth is relative to the camera's own, plus half a turn — so the planet sits
// beyond the black hole rather than off to one side of it. That is what the
// reference frame has, and it is also what makes the approach read: a body on
// the far side is one the fall genuinely closes on, so it grows, just far more
// slowly than the thing being fallen into. The small offset on top takes it off
// the exact axis and puts it to one side.
//
// Elevation is absolute, measured from the disk plane. The camera runs 14 to 5
// degrees above that plane, so at 5.4 the planet sits below the camera for most
// of the fall and only just above it at the end — close to edge-on with the disk
// the whole way. That is low, and it is the one thing here worth a second look:
// the planet passes near the near-side arc rather than reading against open sky,
// and it is only outside the disk at all because the disk stops at r = 6 and the
// orbit is at 12.
//
// Both were picked backwards from the last frame, where the planet used to have
// to clear the shadow or be deleted by it. Sampling along the bent ray removed
// that — see the planet block in fragmentShader.glsl — so the offset that was
// buying clearance now buys nearness instead. Halved from 38/12, the pair that
// first followed the lensing change, which keeps the bearing and halves the
// distance.
//
// Which puts the planet a long way inside the shadow geometrically by the end,
// at about 0.42 of its radius. It will not appear there. Lensing displaces an
// image outward, and an object that far behind the rim comes back out pinned to
// the photon ring — so the last of the fall converges on the ring wherever the
// planet is put, and this number stops meaning much before it gets there.
//
// Which is why the two are traded against each other rather than set apart. The
// pair carries a total angular offset, and only the total has to clear the
// shadow — so elevation can come down if azimuth goes up, and the planet drops
// in the frame without losing any of its margin. It is not an even trade: the
// horizontal axis is compressed by the aspect ratio, so on a wide viewport a
// degree spent sideways costs far less of the frame than a degree spent upward,
// and buys the same separation. Dropping 32/38 to 24/44 lowers the planet by
// about a fifth of the frame and leaves the clearance exactly where it was.
//
// They are wide in total because ORBIT_RADIUS is small — see the note there. The
// two move together: the radius sets how near the axis the planet is while the
// black hole is still far away, the angles set where it ends up once the black
// hole fills the frame, and only a small radius with wide angles gets both.
